# Test Cypress

Public repo to share reproducible testing issues.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Dependencies needed to be able to run the tests.

```
macOS 10.9 and above (64-bit only)
Linux Ubuntu 12.04 and above, Fedora 21 and Debian 8 (64-bit only)
Windows 7 and above
Node
Yarn
```

### Installing

To install the dependencies just run `yarn` or `npm install`

## Running the tests

There are two possible ways to run the tests, headed or headless. In case you want to go for headless run `yarn test` and they will run in the CLI. In case you want to go for the headed run, execute `yarn open`.
The tests are not configured to be recorded and to upload the media to the Dashboard, even though it would be quite an easy step to achieve.
